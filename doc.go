// UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
// as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.
// Read more about TypeIDs in their [spec](https://github.com/jetify-com/typeid).

// This particular implementation provides a go library for generating and parsing TypeIDs
