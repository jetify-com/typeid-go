// TypeIDs are a modern, **type-safe**, globally unique identifier based on the upcoming
// UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
// as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.
// Read more about TypeIDs in their [spec](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid).

// This particular implementation provides a go library for generating and parsing TypeIDs
