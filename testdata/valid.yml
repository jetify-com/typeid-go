# This file contains test data that should parse as valid TypeIDs by conforming
# implementations.
#
# Each example contains:
# - The TypeID in its canonical string representation.
# - The prefix
# - The decoded UUID as a hex string
#
# Implementations should verify that they can encode/decode the data
# in both directions:
# 1. If the TypeID is decoded, it should result in the given prefix and UUID.
# 2. If the UUID is encoded as a TypeID with the given prefix, it should
#    result in the given TypeID.
#
# In addition to using these examples, it's recommended that implementations
# generate a thousands of random ids during testing, and verify that after
# decoding and re-encoding the id, the result is the same as the original.
#
# In other words, the following property should always hold:
# random_typeid == encode(decode(random_typeid))
#
# Finally, while implementations should be able to decode the values below,
# note that not all of them are UUIDv7s. When *generating* new random typeids,
# implementations should always use UUIDv7s.
